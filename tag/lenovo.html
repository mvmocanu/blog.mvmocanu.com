<h2>Long story</h2>
<p>On 06/11/08, I ordered a Lenovo Thinkpad R61 laptop from Lenovo.com
website. After the order was processed, I saw on the status page that my
estimated shipping date is 07/02/08 as you can see in the following
screenshot.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<tt class="docutils">/home/local/3PILLAR/mmocanu/work/blog.mvmocanu.com/content/lenovo-shipping-process-and-customer-support.rst</tt>, line 38)</p>
Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<p>After one week (around 06/17/08) I called customer service to check up
my notebook status and the lady whom I spoke to told me that the
notebook will be shipped around 06/28/08. On 06/30/08 I called again
because the status page wasn't updated and I find out that my shipping
date was delayed to sometime around the week of 07/13/08. But on Lenovo
website the shipping time was the same (07/02/08). After I talked to the
lady, I wrote them an email (on 06/30/08) and in the email that I
receive on 07/01/08 they told me that they estimate the shipping date
around 07/07/08.</p>
<p>Quote from their email:</p>
<blockquote>
We apologize for any frustration we may have caused. We have
contacted our supply team about this issue and they have updated
your estimated ship date to July 7th, 2008.</blockquote>
<p>On 07/03/08 the status on Lenovo website was updated. To 08/06/08. So
almost two months after my order. See the following screenshot.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p>After I saw the new estimated ship date, I wrote them an email in which
I canceled my order, but they didn't answer my email. Around 3pm
(07/03/08) in the same day I called them and I ask them to cancel my
order. They said that it will take 24 hours to confirm the cancellation.
Around 10pm (07/03/08) I checked my email and I receive an email from
Lenovo in which they told me that my laptop was shipped, even though as
I told you, I already canceled the order. See the following screenshot.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p>So after all these, they were late with my shipment by only one day.</p>
<p>On 07/05/08 I receive an email response to my email in which I cancel my
order. The answer at my cancellation was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We see that your order has been shipped already with UPS tracking
number xyz. You may track the progress of your delivery in the UPS
website using the track number provided.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 07/07/08 UPS delivered me the laptop. Everything was ok with the
laptop and it works properly. The funny part is that UPS try to deliver
the laptop to apartment #3 instead of apartment #5. Luckily nobody was
home and I heard them knocking on the door of apartment #3. I checked to
see if they come and they did.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think ThinkPad laptops are very good, but Lenovo
shipping and customer support suck big time.</p>
