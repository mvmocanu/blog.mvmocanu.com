&lt;h2&gt;Short story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ordered the laptop on 06/11/08.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial estimated ship date: 07/02/08.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In around one week they told me that my laptop will be shipped on
06/28/08.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 06/28/08 I found out that my new shipping date will be in the
week of 07/07/08 or 07/13/08.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On 07/03/08 the shipping date is updated on Lenovo website to
08/06/08.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On 07/03/08 I cancel the order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I canceled the order, the laptop is shipped (on on the same
date: 07/03/08).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laptop was delivered by UPS on 07/07/08 and it works properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="long-story"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 06/11/08, I ordered a Lenovo Thinkpad R61 laptop from Lenovo.com
website. After the order was processed, I saw on the status page that my
estimated shipping date is 07/02/08 as you can see in the following
screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;lenovo 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one week (around 06/17/08) I called customer service to check up
my notebook status and the lady whom I spoke to told me that the
notebook will be shipped around 06/28/08. On 06/30/08 I called again
because the status page wasn't updated and I find out that my shipping
date was delayed to sometime around the week of 07/13/08. But on Lenovo
website the shipping time was the same (07/02/08). After I talked to the
lady, I wrote them an email (on 06/30/08) and in the email that I
receive on 07/01/08 they told me that they estimate the shipping date
around 07/07/08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote from their email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We apologize for any frustration we may have caused. We have
contacted our supply team about this issue and they have updated
your estimated ship date to July 7th, 2008.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 07/03/08 the status on Lenovo website was updated. To 08/06/08. So
almost two months after my order. See the following screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="lenovo 2" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2635758105_97a05c822e.jpg?v=0" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;lenovo 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I saw the new estimated ship date, I wrote them an email in which
I canceled my order, but they didn't answer my email. Around 3pm
(07/03/08) in the same day I called them and I ask them to cancel my
order. They said that it will take 24 hours to confirm the cancellation.
Around 10pm (07/03/08) I checked my email and I receive an email from
Lenovo in which they told me that my laptop was shipped, even though as
I told you, I already canceled the order. See the following screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="lenovo 3" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3264/2636582718_9aa5c1732c.jpg?v=0" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;lenovo 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after all these, they were late with my shipment by only one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 07/05/08 I receive an email response to my email in which I cancel my
order. The answer at my cancellation was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that your order has been shipped already with UPS tracking
number xyz. You may track the progress of your delivery in the UPS
website using the track number provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 07/07/08 UPS delivered me the laptop. Everything was ok with the
laptop and it works properly. The funny part is that UPS try to deliver
the laptop to apartment #3 instead of apartment #5. Luckily nobody was
home and I heard them knocking on the door of apartment #3. I checked to
see if they come and they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I think ThinkPad laptops are very good, but Lenovo
shipping and customer support suck big time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
