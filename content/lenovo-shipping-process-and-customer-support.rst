Long story
~~~~~~~~~~

On 06/11/08, I ordered a Lenovo Thinkpad R61 laptop from Lenovo.com
website. After the order was processed, I saw on the status page that my
estimated shipping date is 07/02/08 as you can see in the following
screenshot.

After one week (around 06/17/08) I called customer service to check up
my notebook status and the lady whom I spoke to told me that the
notebook will be shipped around 06/28/08. On 06/30/08 I called again
because the status page wasn't updated and I find out that my shipping
date was delayed to sometime around the week of 07/13/08. But on Lenovo
website the shipping time was the same (07/02/08). After I talked to the
lady, I wrote them an email (on 06/30/08) and in the email that I
receive on 07/01/08 they told me that they estimate the shipping date
around 07/07/08.

Quote from their email:

    We apologize for any frustration we may have caused. We have
    contacted our supply team about this issue and they have updated
    your estimated ship date to July 7th, 2008.

On 07/03/08 the status on Lenovo website was updated. To 08/06/08. So
almost two months after my order. See the following screenshot.

After I saw the new estimated ship date, I wrote them an email in which
I canceled my order, but they didn't answer my email. Around 3pm
(07/03/08) in the same day I called them and I ask them to cancel my
order. They said that it will take 24 hours to confirm the cancellation.
Around 10pm (07/03/08) I checked my email and I receive an email from
Lenovo in which they told me that my laptop was shipped, even though as
I told you, I already canceled the order. See the following screenshot.

So after all these, they were late with my shipment by only one day.

On 07/05/08 I receive an email response to my email in which I cancel my
order. The answer at my cancellation was this:

    We see that your order has been shipped already with UPS tracking
    number xyz. You may track the progress of your delivery in the UPS
    website using the track number provided.

    We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience .

On 07/07/08 UPS delivered me the laptop. Everything was ok with the
laptop and it works properly. The funny part is that UPS try to deliver
the laptop to apartment #3 instead of apartment #5. Luckily nobody was
home and I heard them knocking on the door of apartment #3. I checked to
see if they come and they did.

In conclusion, I think ThinkPad laptops are very good, but Lenovo
shipping and customer support suck big time.
